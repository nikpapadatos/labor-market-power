## üìÑ Abstract

Labor economics often assumes a fully competitive labor market where wages equal the marginal revenue product of labor. However, recent evidence suggests that firms exhibit substantial wage-setting power.  
This thesis estimates the degree of **monopsony power** in hospital labor markets using a **discrete choice (logit) framework**, inspired by the industrial organization literature (Berry 1994; Azar, Berry & Marinescu 2022).

Using California hospital-level data (2014‚Äì2023), I estimate the elasticity of nurse labor supply and corresponding **wage markdowns**.  
Results indicate that hospitals pay Registered Nurses approximately **6% below their marginal product**, implying moderate but meaningful monopsony power.
